Feature: Release tooling
  A release is a pull request that sets the version in moon.mod and adds its
  section to CHANGELOG.md (`release prepare`). When it merges, the Release
  workflow decides to release (`release plan`), tags the commit, publishes,
  and creates the GitHub release from the section (`release notes`).

  Scenario Outline: Choose the next version from git-cliff
    Given git-cliff exits with <code> and prints "<stdout>"
    Then the printed version is "<version>"

    Examples:
      | code | stdout   | version |
      | 0    | v0.2.0   | v0.2.0  |
      | 1    | v0.2.0   | v0.1.0  |
      | 0    |          | v0.1.0  |
      | 127  |          | v0.1.0  |

  Scenario Outline: Read a version
    When I read the version "<text>"
    Then the version is "<version>"

    Examples:
      | text    | version |
      | 0.3.0   | 0.3.0   |
      | v0.3.0  | 0.3.0   |
      | 1.10.20 | 1.10.20 |
      | v10.0.0 | 10.0.0  |

  Scenario Outline: Reject what is not a version
    When I read the version "<text>"
    Then it fails with "not a version: <text>"

    Examples:
      | text        |
      | 0.3         |
      | 0.3.0.1     |
      | 0.3.x       |
      | 0.3.0-rc.1  |
      | vv0.3.0     |
      | 0..3        |

  Scenario Outline: Choose the release version
    When I choose the release version with request "<request>", computed "<computed>" and current "<current>"
    Then the version is "<version>"

    Examples:
      | request | computed | current | version |
      |         | v0.3.0   | 0.2.0   | 0.3.0   |
      |         | v0.2.1   | 0.2.0   | 0.2.1   |
      | 1.0.0   | v0.3.0   | 0.2.0   | 1.0.0   |
      | v0.2.5  | v0.3.0   | 0.2.0   | 0.2.5   |

  Scenario Outline: The release version must be above the current one
    When I choose the release version with request "<request>", computed "<computed>" and current "<current>"
    Then it fails with "<message>"

    Examples:
      | request | computed | current | message                                                                                   |
      |         | v0.2.0   | 0.2.0   | version 0.2.0 is not above the current version 0.2.0; nothing to release, or pass a higher version |
      | 0.1.9   | v0.3.0   | 0.2.0   | version 0.1.9 is not above the current version 0.2.0; nothing to release, or pass a higher version |
      | next    | v0.3.0   | 0.2.0   | not a version: next                                                                       |
